# My Very First Blog

Hi everyone, my name is Nevaeh Pineda and I am majoring in health science.

My goal in life is to become an ultrasound tech and to hopefully learn spanish.

I enjoy reading, singing, paint, and playing video games. I currently play Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Among Us.

My favorite subject in college so far is Anatomy.
