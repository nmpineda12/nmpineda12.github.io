I chose hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer as my cancer research topic.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is proven to have less than 200,000 cases in the US per year.

It can be detected through blood tests, ultrasound imaging, and liver biopsy.

Behaviors that put you at a greater risk are alcohol consumption,

obesity, metabolic disorders, aging, and a few other factors.

Hepatocellular carcinoma has 5 stages such as stage 0, stage A, stage B, stage C,

stage D. Available treatments are surgery, radiation therapy,targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy,

chemotherapy, and palliative care. For someone with early stages of cancer

have a 5-year survival rate of 50-90%. People in their late stages of this type of liver cancer have a life expectany

of 6-8 months without treatment, but 11-13 months with treatment.
